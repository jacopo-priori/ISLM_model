Interactive representation of the IS-LM Model available at https://www.islm.website/ (developed with Matteo Ferrazza)

<br><br>

- This representation is of a closed economy in the short run, where prices are sticky and output is demand driven. Given a short run fixed price level, this macroeconomic tool shows what determines national output (Mankiw & Taylor, 2014).
- The "liquidity preference-money supply" (LM) curve consists of all the combinations between output and interest rate in which the money market is in equilibrium. The "investment-saving" (IS) curve does the same, but referring to the goods and services market. They intersect at a point of general equilibrium, where there are simultaneous equilibria in both markets. The interest rate is the variable that influences both of them and that links them together (here it is assumed that it can not be negative).
- John Hicks initially developed this model in 1937, and it was subsequently expanded upon by Alvin Hansen. It serves as a mathematical representation of the Keynesian macroeconomic theory. From the 1940s to the mid-1970s, it held a dominant position as the primary framework for macroeconomic analysis.
