    <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model:</b>
    <ul>
        This representation is of a closed economy in the short run, where prices are sticky and output is demand driven.
        Given a short run fixed price level, this macroeconomic tool shows what determines national output.
        <br>
        The "liquidity preference-money supply" (LM) curve consists of all the combinations between output and interest rate in which the money market is in equilibrium.
        The "investment-saving" (IS) curve does the same, but referring to the goods and services market.
        They intersect at a point of general equilibrium, where there are simultaneous equilibria in both markets.
        The interest rate is the variable that influences both of them and that links them together.
        <br>
        John Hicks initially developed this model in 1937, and it was subsequently expanded upon by Alvin Hansen.
        It serves as a mathematical representation of the Keynesian macroeconomic theory.
        From the 1940s to the mid-1970s, it held a dominant position as the primary framework for macroeconomic analysis.
    </ul>
