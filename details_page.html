    <b>The model:</b><br>
    The IS-LM model is a macroeconomic tool that illustrates the correlation between interest rates and real output. <br>
    It establishes a point of intersection between the "investment-saving" (IS) and "liquidity preference-money supply" (LM) curves,<br>
    which signifies a state of general equilibrium where simultaneous equilibria are assumed to exist in both the goods and asset markets.<br>
    John Hicks initially developed this model in 1937, and it was subsequently expanded upon by Alvin Hansen.<br>
    It serves as a mathematical representation of Keynesian macroeconomic theory. <br>From the 1940s to the mid-1970s,
    it held a dominant position as the primary framework for macroeconomic analysis.<br><br>
